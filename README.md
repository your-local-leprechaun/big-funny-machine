# The Big Happy Machine
This is a code snippet to basically send you to funny videos on the internet whenever you need some dopamine. You might ask what would lead a man to make this? Well that's easy to answer. Finals. I need sleep so badly but all I can do is code.

## Download
To download this program, press the green code button and download as zip. Extract the files and open the .exe file, and then you're good to go! You might need to force it to run as it sometimes says it looks like a virus. Then get started and it's pretty easy to use. Press enter to get a new video, and press 'n' to exit the program.

## Other Stuff
There are over 100 videos, so you will get repeats, but there are a lot to find! I hope you enjoy and it makes you a bit happy!
